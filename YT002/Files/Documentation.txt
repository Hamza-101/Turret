Parameters of cv2.VideoWriter
'output.avi':

Type: str
Description: This is the filename of the video file that will be created. You can specify the full path if you want to save it to a different location. The extension (e.g., .avi) typically indicates the file format.
fourcc:

Type: int
Description: This is the FourCC code that specifies the video codec used for encoding the video. The fourcc parameter is obtained using cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'CODE') where 'CODE' is a four-character string representing the codec (e.g., 'XVID', 'MJPG', 'X264'). The codec determines how the video data is compressed and decompressed.
20.0:

Type: float
Description: This is the frame rate of the video, in frames per second (FPS). It controls how many frames are shown per second in the final video. A typical value might be 20.0, but it can be adjusted depending on your needs (e.g., 30.0 for standard video or 60.0 for high frame rate).
(frame_width, frame_height):

Type: tuple of (int, int)
Description: This is a tuple specifying the width and height of the video frames. It should match the dimensions of the frames that you are writing to the video file. The video writer will use these dimensions to encode each frame correctly.
